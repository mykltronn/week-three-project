# week-three-project

## This is my initial submission for the Week Three Project. 

### It meets basic standards plus a bit more:  
+ handles complex chains  
+ has working decimal  
+ takes in to account order of operations  

### Before duedate I plan to:  
+ clean code, use external functions where possible to tidy up  
+ add modulo  
+ add exponentiation  
+ add basic open/close parentheses keys  
+ add some groovy js button styling
